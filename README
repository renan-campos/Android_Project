ParkMyCar is an Anroid application I created my freshman year of college with two other students.

Project Description:

This Android app locates parking spaces on or around UML campus, based on a variety of specific circumstances (i.e. On Campus, price, location). In addition, the app would be able to tell you about restaurants or other attractions, particularly ones that are open at the time. Ideally, guests of students (or anyone) around Lowell, looking for a place to park could locate the closest street, garage or lot parking at the cheapest rate, within walking distance of where they plan to go. It can be used in the same way if someone is looking to get something to eat at odd hours, and might not have a car. They would need to find a place within walking distance of their location (and hopefully serves decent food). Eventually, it could be used as a way for restaurants to advertise to the college student demographic, if they have late night hours etc. Coupons or discounts could be included in later versions. 

I was responsible for the Graphical User Interface, parsing a text file with parking spots to create an array, sorting that array based on the user's input and displaying the output data.

One partner was responsible for using the Google Maps API to get the user's current location and create a route to the desired parking spot.
My other partner created the text file of parking spots in Lowell, include a name, longitude, latitude, price, if it was on campus and if it was restaraunt parking.

The parkMyCar Directory has only the code that I wrote, and what is automatically generated by the ADT. 
The .apk file is the completed version of the Android App.
